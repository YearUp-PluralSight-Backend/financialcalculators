/**
 * The MortgageCalculator class calculates monthly mortgage payments and the total interest paid over the loan term.
 *
 * <p>
 * It uses the following mortgage formula to calculate the monthly payment:
 * M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n â€“ 1 ]
 *
 * Where:
 * M: is the monthly payment
 * P: is the loan amount (principal)
 * i: is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)
 * n: is the total number of monthly payments (years of loan multiplied by 12)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The class provides two key calculations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Monthly Payment: The amount to be paid each month for the mortgage.</li>
 *   <li>Total Interest: The total interest paid over the loan term.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The user is prompted to input the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term in years.
